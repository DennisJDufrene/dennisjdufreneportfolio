# How to find an RSS URL by Viewing Page Source?

If you are having trouble finding the RSS Feed URL for a site, try viewing the page source. This post will walk you through a quick way to see if a site publishes an RSS or Atom feed by viewing the page source. Don't worry, it is not as technical as it sounds.

1. Go to a website you are interested in using your favorite web browser.

2. On the webpage, right-click to get the menu and click **View Page Source**. On mobile devices, add `view-source:` in front of the URL.

4. In the **Find** field, enter `rss`. If nothing is found for `rss`, try `atom` as some sites prefer Atom feeds. Your feed reader should be able to subscribe to both Atom and RSS feeds.
